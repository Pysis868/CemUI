# How can I help? / I have a suggestion!
We **always** welcome suggestions and Pull Requests! This program is written in NodeJS and packaged with Electron. This means that anyone with experience in JavaScript, Node, HTML, CSS, and C++ can contribute just fine! With Node, C++ users can contribute as well, due to Node supporting C++ modules!

**If you have a suggestion, and do not know any of the required languages, you can reach us on our [Discord server][1]**

# How to get the latest version of CemUI

2. Clone/Download this repo

## I found a bug!
Given that this project is still very early in development, bugs will probably be common, and vary from person to person. If you find a bug, we ask that you follow this format for reporting the bug on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RedDuckss/CemUI/issues) on the repo:
- A detailed name describing the bug (no "A bug happened" type titles!)
- A detailed description of the bug

- Exact steps to reproduce
- A screenshot/video of the bug/error message
- List games affected (if applicable)
- If possible, a video or gif showing the exact steps to reproduce (There are many free video recorders out there. It doesn't matter how you record it, as long as it's recorded)
- And above all: stay calm. Currently there are only 2 developers working on this project, and for one this is the first NodeJS app they have worked on. Also given the nature of how Electron packages apps, bugs may not occur on our end but will on yours. Please be patient while we attempt to fix the issue.
