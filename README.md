# CemuManager
A small launcher for the Cemu WiiU emulator made with Electron

## What is it?
CemuManager is a small fan-project aimed as practice for me in developing Electron apps. CemuManager is a small launcher "hub" for your Cemu games, allowing you to launch games in Cemu from the application.

## Goals
Getting the thing fully working. A lot of planned, and suggested, features are not yet implemented. It is nowhere near done. Eventually I'd like to expand CemuManager to support multiple WiiU emulators, and evetually for it to become an all-in-one launcher for all emulators.

- [x] Lanuch games with other emulators
