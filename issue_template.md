Given that this project is still very early in development, bugs will probably be common, and vary from person to person. If you find a bug, we ask that you follow this format for reporting the bug:

- A detailed name describing the bug (no "A bug happened" type titles!)

- A detailed description of the bug

- Exact steps to reproduce

- A screenshot/video of the bug/error message

- List games affected (if applicable)

- If possible, a video or gif showing the exact steps to reproduce (There are many free video recorders out there. It doesn't matter how you record it, as long as it's recorded)
